# To-Do List App with Java Spring Boot

Welcome to my Java Spring Boot To-Do List application! This project showcases my skills in building a robust back-end application with database integration, user data security, route validation, and deployment.

## Features

- **Database Integration**: The application is integrated with a RESTful API, allowing seamless interaction with a database to store and manage tasks.

- **Data Security**: Data privacy is a top priority. I've implemented robust security measures to protect user data.

- **Route Validation**: Every route is meticulously validated, ensuring the application remains secure and reliable.

- **Deployment**: The back-end is ready for deployment, enabling hassle-free delivery to production environments.
